## **Core Idea:** 

## **"Sheba Retention AI" \- Churn Prevention & Loyalty Engine**

### **The Problem**

Sheba.xyz loses **65%** of customers after first booking. Getting customers is costing between **Tk 800-1200 per customer**, yet they vanish without a trace with a lifetime value of Tk 50,000 and more. The response rates of **generic retention** campaigns are 8-12%.

**Bottom line**: Sheba is spending a lot on **customer acquisition** but lacks a **customer retention system.**

### **Why It Matters**

* Customer retention is **5-7 times** cheaper than customer acquisition.  
* Retention growth of **5 percent \= 25-95 percen**t profit growth (Harvard Business Review).  
* Existing **35% retention \=Tk 52 cror**e loss of revenue every year.  
* Increasing competition (PathaoHome, Shohoz, Obhai).

### **Our Solution**

**Sheba Retention AI-** an Artificial intelligence (AI) engine that anticipates the customers who will leave 45-60 days before the end date and automatically initiates personalized interventions..

* **Churn prediction model:**  "Not booked in 45 days, competitor search in the past day, 78% churn risk"  
* **Personalized intervention:**  
  * High value **customer drifting**: "Tk 500 discount on all 3 bookings ahead"  
  * **Price-sensitive**: "We now have a budget service category.  
  * Complainers of quality: "Use our new verified premium providers.  
* **Re-engagement triggers:**  
  * Your AC requires seasonal service \- reserve.  
  * Karim, your **preferred electrician** is free this weekend.  
* **Loyalty tier system:** **AI** automatically **divides** the users (Bronze/Silver/Gold) into personalized benefits.  
* **Lifetime value predictor:** "This customer is worth Tk 50K over 3 years \- invest Tk 2K to retain"

**Example**:

**Alert:**

**Rahima \- Last booking 52 days ago**

**Churn risk:** 78%   **Predicted value:** Tk 45,000

**Reason:** Price-sensitive, searched competitors

**Action:** Send Tk 300 discount \+ maintenance reminder

**Expected retention:** 68%      **ROI:** 1,500%

### **What Makes It Unique**

1. **Proactive:** Before churn (68 successes out of 100\) vs winback (15 successes out of 100\) reactive.  
2. **Individual:** Various discounts on high-value, price-sensitive, and quality-focused users.  
3. **Local:** Bengali assistance, bKash/bank assimilation, knows when AC season, Eid patterns.  
4. **Explainable:** Demystifies the reasons behind customer turnover and the reasons behind certain behaviors.  
5. **ROI-oriented:** Lifetime value calculates the best investment per customer.

## **Feasibility & Growth Potential**

## **Why It's Practical**

**Data ready**: Sheba already has 3 \+ years, 1M \+ bookings \- no data gathering is required.

**Proven tech**: Standard ML (XGBoost, clustering) having 75-85 accuracy \- not experimental.

**Fast build**: 24-hour MVP possible:

* Hours 0-8: Data prep and feature engineering  
* Hours 8-16: Train models (churn, segmentation, LTV)  
* Hours 16-24: Dashboard with live predictions

**Low cost**: Python \+ open-source libraries, runs on free Heroku tier

### **Better Than Existing Solutions**

| Feature | Salesforce/HubSpot | Sheba Retention AI |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Cost | Tk 150K-500K/month | **Tk 20K/month** |
| Bangladesh features | None | **bKash, Bengali, seasonal patterns** |
| Setup time | 3-6 months | **48 hours** |
| Customization | Generic templates | **Custom-trained on Sheba data** |

### **Growth Path**

**Phase 1 (3 months)**: Core retention \- 35% \-  45% retention  
**Phase 2 (6 months)**: Automation \- 10K interventions/month  
**Phase 3 (12 months)**: Advanced AI \- Next-service prediction, 55% retention, Tk 15 crore recovered  
**Phase 4 (Year 2+)**: White-label to other platforms (PathaoHome, food delivery, e-commerce)

**Market**: 70-80 platforms in Bangladesh (home services, food, e-commerce, rides) × Tk 8-15 lakh/year \= **Tk 50-120 crore market**

## **Technology Stack & AI Tools**
